Georgia Tech Taido is Georgia Tech's longest running Group Fitness class (25+ years) which teaches the Japanese martial art of [Taido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taid%C5%8D), a style of karate developed for the 21st century by Dr. Seiken Shukumine.

Founded by Bryan Sparks in 1996, we are a group of hard-working, fun-loving people who enjoy training hard and partying harder.

We maintain close ties to the [US Taido Association](https://www.taidokarate.com/) headquarters (or *honbu* in Japanese) and regularly participate in events such as Kangeiko, Summer Camp, National Tournament, etc.
